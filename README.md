Build a local “release operations” tool that captures one set of inputs per release (Single or EP) and then: Produces a DistroKid-ready distribution pack + checklist (human submits in DistroKid). Automates uploads where it’s technically feasible. Produces a social posting pack  and hands off to a scheduler UI for publishing.
