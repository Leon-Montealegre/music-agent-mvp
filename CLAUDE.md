# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Music-agent-mvp is a local "release operations" tool for music releases (Singles or EPs). It:
- Captures inputs per release and produces a DistroKid-ready distribution pack + checklist
- Automates uploads where technically feasible
- Produces a social posting pack for publishing via a scheduler UI

## Current State

This project is in early development. Build, test, and lint infrastructure will be added as the codebase develops.
